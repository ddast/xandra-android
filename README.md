your PC.

## Connecting

1. Connect your PC and phone to your private LAN.
   Using xandra in an untrusted network environment (internet, LAN with
   untrusted parties) would be a horrible idea, since xandra uses neither
   authentication nor encryption.
2. Run xandra on your PC.
3. Run xandra on your phone.
   Enter the server hostname (xandra on your PC will print the hostname in case
   you don't know) or IP address and hit connect.

## Using xandra

* All text entered into the text field will be send to your PC.
  It does not matter how the text is entered, thus, all input methods such as
  typing, pasting or speech recognition should work.
* The â€¦ button toggles a special keys bar containing *Escape*, *Tab*, *Ctrl*,
  *Super*, *Alt*, arrow keys, volume keys, middle mouse click, *Insert*,
  *Delete*, *Home*, *End*, *PageUp/Down* and function keys.
  The keys *Ctrl*, *Super* and *Alt* are usually used as modifier keys and
  therefore wait for the next character.
  So hitting *Ctrl* and then *q* will be interpreted as the combination
  *Ctrl+q*.
  To only type a modifier key without a second key, hit the button twice.
* The empty area beyond the text field is used to control the mouse and works
  similar to the touchpad of laptops.
  Note that hiding the keyboard will increase the space for mouse control.
  A fast tap is interpreted as a left mouse click and a long press as a
  right mouse click.
  Vertical scrolling works as a two-finger gesture (actually the maximum
  vertical movement of your two fingers is used, so it is possible to rest
  the thumb of one hand on the touch screen and use one finger of the other
  hand for movement).
  Drag and drop is implemented as a fast tap, quickly followed by a move
  gesture.
